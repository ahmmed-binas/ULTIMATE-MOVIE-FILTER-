# ULTIMATE-MOVIE-FILTER-
done with the interface.. ready to use 

This Application can help you find movies easily and more efficiently on one of the most used sites(swatchseries) 



how to use:
-just paste the link of the page where there is more movies (expected from the swatchseries site)

-if your looking for a specific genre ,ratings choose the option from the dropbox(but its just better to type how many movies do you want to extract from the link and press sumbit)

-sumbmit(search)


how it works in general:
-first when you put a link and search it extracts all the link from the link you gave
-then , it goes thru how many links(movies) you want to search
-after that, then from the link it extracts the needed information like the ratings,title etc...
-then.. it displays in a list.
-if you want need the review box again (after pressing the do not show again option) install the application again or if your running by code delete the txt file called do_not_show_review.txt.:)..
 ENJOY(SWATCH VIEWERS)
