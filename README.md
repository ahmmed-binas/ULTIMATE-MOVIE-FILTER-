How to Use:

Paste the link of the page containing multiple movies from the Swatchseries site.
If you're looking for a specific genre or ratings, choose the options from the dropdown box. However, it's often more effective to specify how many movies you want to extract from the link and press submit.
Submit (Search)

When you enter a link and search, the application extracts all the links from the provided page.
It then processes the specified number of links (movies) you want to search.
From those links, it extracts the necessary information such as ratings, title, etc.
Finally, it displays the information in a list.
Note:

If you need the review box again after selecting the "Do not show again" option, reinstall the application. If you are running it by code, delete the text file named do_not_show_review.txt.
Enjoy, Swatchseries Viewers!
